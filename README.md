# Spatiotemporal analysis of the impacts of environmental degradation and climate variation on malaria re-emergence in Venezuela

This repository contains R scripts used to produce analysis of the impact of environmental gradation, specifically mining, and climate  variation on malaria in southern Venezuela.

Results are being prepared for publication and review.

The analysis workflow is as follows:
1. Detection of best monthly time lags for including El Nino into spatiotemporal models of malaria incidence
2. Spatiotemporal modelling of malaria incidence in Bol√≠var state, southern Venezuela. This also included random effect analysis and testing for the interactions between environmental degradation and climate variation.
3. Visualisation of results
4. Preparation of supplementary material to support findings
5. Descriptive statistics included in the main text

Scripts used to extract measures of forest decrease and urbanization from land cover maps, for analysis are also included.
